# Travis

Let's do everything through the website to keep things simple and not using the terminal!

You should see a list of your repositories and in your [profile](https://app.travis-ci.com/account/repositories), you should be sure to activate Github Apps integration.

## Saving Time
We have limited free credits available on Travis CI. This means that we have probably around [1000 build minutes](https://github.com/matsim-org/matsim-libs/issues/1259) and the book make take around 10 minutes or even more to run. Ways to save time involve caching, throuch which we can add the following to our `.travis.yml` file:
```
sudo: false

cache:
  packages: yes
  directories:
    - $TRAVIS_BUILD_DIR/_bookdown_files
```
